Can a sensor be in more than one collection based on the code you wrote? Why or why not? What are the implications of a sensor being in more than one collection? 
Yes, it can be in more than one collection since we are using subscription to communicate. One sensor can have more than one subscriptions. 
When one sensor is in more than one collections, it means it will give the report back to whichever collections it belongs to.

How could you ensure that only certain picos can raise an event that causes a temperature report to be generated? 
We can set a condition for certain subscription of the pico to raise the event to generate the temperature report.

How do the debug logs show that your scatter-gather system worked?
We check the correlation id on the debug logs.

How can you know a report is done and all the sensors that are going to respond have reported? 
We use a counter to count how many picos have responded. If it equals to the amount we expectd, it means all of them have reported.

Given your answer above, how would you recover if the number of responding sensors is less than the total number of sensors? 
I can have another rule to check if the corresponding is not equal to the desired, I will resend the request to the one that hasn't sent the report back.
