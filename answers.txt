This lab uses a vector clock (Links to an external site.) algorithm to create unique message IDs based on a sequence number. Could we replace the sequence number with a timestamp? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach?
Are the temperature messages in order? Why or why not? If not, what could you do to fix this?
How did you avoid looping (sending messages back to someone who already has it)? Why was the unique ID helpful?
The propagation algorithm sleeps for n seconds between each iteration. What are the trade-offs between a low and high value for n.
Did new messages eventually end on all the nodes that were connected? Were the messages displayed in the same order on each node? Why or why not?
Why does temporarily disconnecting a node from the network not result in permanent gaps in the messages seen at that node?
Describe, in a paragraph or two, how you could use the basic scheme implemented here to add failure detection to the system using a reachability table.
